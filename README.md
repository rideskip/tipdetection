# Tip-over Detection

This repository contains scooter tip-over data published by Skip.

### Summary

The tip-over data contains local timestamp and latitude/longitude information regarding each tip-over. Tip-overs are from Skip's DC Metro area scooters. Response times listed are calculated from the time of the tip-over alert creation to the time of resolution. Note that latitude/longitude values are subject to standard GPS accuracy limitations.
